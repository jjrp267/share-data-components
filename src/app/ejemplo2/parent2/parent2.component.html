<h3>Ejemplo 2: Child to Parent: Sharing Data via ViewChild</h3>
<div class="colores2">

  ViewChild allows a one component to be injected into another, giving the parent access to its attributes and functions. One caveat, however, is that child wonâ€™t be available until after the view has been initialized. This means we need to implement the AfterViewInit lifecycle hook to receive the data from the child.
